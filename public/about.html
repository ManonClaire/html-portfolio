<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an enthusiastic mathematician and biologist with a dual academic background, eager to tackle complex challenges and contribute innovative solutions.
  My friends and family describe me as a friendly, people-oriented individual with an insatiable curiosity and passion for continuous learning.
  I want to leverage my analytical skills and adaptability in a dynamic, high-performance environment where I can grow professionally while contributing meaningfully to organisational goals.
  I am interested in both data analytics and consulting positions in companies that want to help me succeed in what I do.</p>

<p>Ever since I was little, I have loved learning.
  A little odd in this day and age where school is your worst enemy, but expanding my knowledge and learning new skills was my favourite pastime as a kid.
  That also translated into my university career.
  I started a mathematics degree and later a biology degree purely because I did not want to stop learning.
  I take on small challenges left and right, like writing a fiction book, learning languages on Duolingo (I have started several, among which Japanese, Russian and Norwegian) and now I am taking my first steps in the coding world.</p>

<p>To be completely honest, I have felt a little stuck recently.
  Most jobs with a mathematics degree have in link with finance, which does not really interest me.
  I want to use my mathematical skills for other purposes, for example to analyse results from biological experiments or to optimise certain processes of development.
  I have two major dreams warring in my head: becoming an arctic biologist studying arctic wildlife and going on expeditions, and working as a performance engineer in Formula 1.
  Unfortunately, they both seem mutually exclusive and I have no idea which dream to prioritise right now.</p>
